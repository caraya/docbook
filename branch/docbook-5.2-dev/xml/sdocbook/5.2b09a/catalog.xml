<!-- This is a catalog data file for DocBook Simplified. It is
     provided as a convenience in building your own catalog files. You
     need not use the filenames listed here, and need not use the
     filename method of identifying storage objects at all. See the
     documentation for detailed information on the files associated
     with the DocBook DTD. See XML Catalogs at
     http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/ for detailed
